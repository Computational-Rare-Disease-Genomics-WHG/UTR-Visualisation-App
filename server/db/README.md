# db

This is the directory that will hold the SQLite3 files once the pipeline is finalized. 

For prototyping and testing purposes, I have put the raw files here. 

But when the pipeline is reading this will essentially hold a db.sqlite3 file and access to it will be based on the FLASK-SQLAlchemy ORM
